// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if number % 2 == 0:
   number is even
elif number % 2 != 0:
   number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

def average_of_five(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5):
  num_list = [num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]
  avg_five = sum(num_list)/len(num_list)
  min_five = min(num_list)
  max_five = max(num_list)
  print("The average of the five numbers given is {average}. The lowest amount of the five numbers is {minimum} and the greatest amount is {maximum}.".format(average=avg_five, minimum=min_five, maximum=max_five))
